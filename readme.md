STEP 1 - Dashboard Feedback
1.  Create a new workplace in slack, and install our app (search Incognito AI on slack app directory). Now head to https://app.incognitoapps.com/login and login to the dashboard. Record yourself while exploring the dashboard and give feedback on it, like how we can improve the design or functionality overall?

STEP 2 - Feature Development
1. Build a page that shows a wall of recognitions for this tenant(T01HP7H5HME) as if they were logged in to the dashboard
2. Each recognition will be a card that displays cleanly all of the data you think that should be shown to the employees
3. The page should be searchable/filterable
   - Search by giver/receiver name or recognition message
   - Filter by date range
   - Filter by company values
4. The page should use the React-Masonry-CSS package to build the "Wall of recognitions"
5. The page should load 20 recognitions and then load 20 more when you hit the bottom to create an infinite scroll
6. Most of the design should be done using Mantine components. Any custom design/tweaking should use Tailwind CSS
